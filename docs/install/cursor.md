# Install in Cursor

## Full plugin

Arcade isn't in Cursor's public marketplace yet, so the install depends on your
Cursor plan.

### Individual plans

Clone this repository into Cursor's local plugin folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ArcadeAI/arcade-plugin ~/.cursor/plugins/local/arcade-plugin
```

Reload Cursor (**Developer: Reload Window**), then open **Customize** and
confirm 2 skills, the `arcade-operator` agent, the `arcade` rule, and the
`arcade` MCP server. To update later, run `git pull` in that folder and reload.

Do not symlink to a folder outside `~/.cursor/plugins/local/` — Cursor ignores
external symlink targets.

### Teams and Enterprise

Local plugins are controlled by the admin setting **Allow Local Plugin
Imports** (off by default on Enterprise). When it's off, Cursor ignores
`~/.cursor/plugins/local` entirely. Use a team marketplace instead:

1. An admin opens **Dashboard → Plugins & MCPs → Team Marketplaces → Add
   Marketplace → Import from Repo** and pastes
   `https://github.com/ArcadeAI/arcade-plugin`.
2. Each person opens **Customize**, finds **Arcade**, and selects **Install**.

Either way, Cursor reads `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` first, so it loads
`skills/`, the operator, the Cursor rule, the session hook (Cursor CLI only),
and the gateway — not just the portable Agent Plugins core.

## Tools only (one click)

This adds the gateway only — no skills.
