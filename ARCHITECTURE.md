# Architecture

A portable Agent Plugin (`plugin.json`, `mcp.json`, `skills/`) plus the files
each client needs at its own path. Every client-specific file is generated
from a few sources by `npm run generate`; `npm run verify` fails if one was
edited by hand. The package ships no credentials.

| Source (edit these) | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `plugin.json`, `mcp.json`, `VERSION` | identity, gateway URL, version, Codex listing metadata |
| `hooks/routing-guidance.mjs` | the routing rules, as sentences |
| `hooks/hook-hosts.mjs` | which hook script runs on which event in which client |
| `hooks/telemetry-contract.mjs` | every telemetry event, property, and allowed value; the tables in `docs/telemetry.md` |
| `agents/arcade-operator.agent.md` | the operator, outside its generated rules block |
| `skills/` | the skills, outside the generated rules block in try-arcade |

`scripts/generate-manifests.mjs` writes every generated file; the generated
`.gitattributes` lists them (GitHub collapses them in diffs).

- The operator lives at `agents/arcade-operator.agent.md`, the only place both
  Claude Code and Cowork accept. Copilot CLI and VS Code only read
  `com.github.copilot/agents/`, so the generator copies it there.
- Each hook command passes `--host <name>`; the script prints the output
  format that client reads.
- Codex doesn't run plugin hooks for Agent Plugins packages yet; see
  [docs/install/codex.md](docs/install/codex.md).

Release Please bumps `VERSION`, `plugin.json`, and the version fields in the
generated manifests; a test replays that bump and checks nothing goes stale.

## Execution model

Skills should activate from the outcome the person asks for; they must not
require a `/do`-style command. Hosts that expose skills still let the user
invoke `/try-arcade` or `/scale-arcade` by name. When a compatible host can
delegate to `arcade-operator`, the parent agent keeps the user-facing
reasoning and hands tool discovery and execution to the operator. Otherwise
it follows the same Arcade discovery and execution loop itself.

  operator returns one of:
    completed | needs_auth | needs_confirmation | needs_clarification | failed
```

The parent remains responsible for user-facing clarification, sign-in, and
confirmation. The operator returns one bounded outcome instead of inventing
success or narrating tool internals.

## Observability boundary

The Arcade MCP server is the canonical place to record request, authentication,
tool-discovery, tool-call, and completion outcomes. This package does not ask a
model to self-report tokens, turns, or success.

In Claude Code, `hooks/telemetry.mjs` also sends usage events on whether the
model used Arcade when a prompt looked like a task Arcade could do. They carry
a random install ID, not the user's name, email, or Arcade account. It is on by
default, turned off with `ARCADE_PLUGIN_TELEMETRY=0` or Claude Code's own
`DISABLE_TELEMETRY`, and described in
[docs/telemetry.md](docs/telemetry.md). The network send runs in a detached
`hooks/telemetry-send.mjs`, so a turn never waits on the network. Every event
and property is defined once, in `hooks/telemetry-contract.mjs`; the docs
tables are generated from it and the tests validate built events against it.
